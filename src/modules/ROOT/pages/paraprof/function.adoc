== Function Based Displays

ParaProf has two displays for showing a single function across all threads of execution. This chapter describes the Function Bar Graph Window and the Function Histogram Window.

[[paraprof.function.bargraph]]
== Function Bar Graph

.Function Bar Graph

This display graphs the values that the particular function had for each thread along with the mean and standard deviation across the threads. You may also change the units and metric displayed from the _Options_ menu.

[[paraprof.function.histogram]]
== Function Histogram

.Function Histogram

This display shows a histogram of each thread's value for the given function. Hover the mouse over a given bar to see the range minimum and maximum and how many threads fell into that range. You may also change the units and metric displayed from the _Options_ menu.

You may also dynamically change how many bins are used (1-100) in the histogram. This option is available from the _Options_ menu. Changing the number of bins can dramatically change the shape of the histogram, play around with it to get a feel for the true distribution of the data.
