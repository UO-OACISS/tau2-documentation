[[InstallPerfExplorer]]
= Installation and Configuration

PerfExplorer uses TAUdb and PerfDMF databases so if you have not already you will need to install TAUdb, see <<taudb-intro>>. After installing and configuring TAU the perfexplorer executable should be available in your `[path to tau]/tau2/[arch]/bin` directory. You will need to run `perfexplorer_configure`, installed at the same location as perfexplorer, to set up your database for use with perfexplorer and to download additional 3rd party jar files perfexplorer requires. When prompted by `perfexplorer_configure` give the name of your PerfDMF or TAUdb database and press Y to agree to download the jar files.
