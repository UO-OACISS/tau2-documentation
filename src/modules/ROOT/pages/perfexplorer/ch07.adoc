[[SettingChartParameters]]
== Setting Parameters

There are a few parameters which need to be set when doing comparisons between trials in the database. If any necessary setting is not configured before requesting a chart, you will be prompted to set the value. The following settings may be necessary for the various charts available:

[[GroupOfInterest]]
=== Group of Interest

TAU events are often associated with common groups, such as "MPI", "TRANSPOSE", etc. This value is used for showing what fraction of runtime that this group of events contributed to the total runtime.

[[MetricOfInterest]]
=== Metric of Interest

Profiles may contain many metrics gathered for a single trial. This selects which of the available metrics the user is interested in.

[[EventOfInterest]]
=== Event of Interest

Some charts examine events in isolation. This setting configures which event to examine.

[[TotalNumberOfTimesteps]]
=== Total Number of Timesteps

One chart, the "Timesteps per second" chart, will calculate the number of timesteps completed per second. This setting configures that value.

[[ChartTypes]]
== Standard Chart Types

[[TimestepsPerSecond]]
=== Timesteps Per Second

The Timesteps Per Second chart shows how an application scales as it relates to time-to-solution. If the timesteps are not already set, you will be prompted to enter the total number of timesteps in the trial (see link:#TotalNumberOfTimesteps[???] ). If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see link:#MetricOfInterest[???]). To request this chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

[[RelativeEfficiency]]
=== Relative Efficiency

The Relative Efficiency chart shows how an application scales with respect to relative efficiency. That is, as the number of processors increases by a factor, the time to solution is expected to decrease by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The fraction between the expected scaling and the actual scaling is the relative efficiency. If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see link:#MetricOfInterest[???]). To request this chart, select one experiment or view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

[[RelativeEfficiencyByEvent]]
=== Relative Efficiency by Event

The Relative Efficiency By Event chart shows how each event in an application scales with respect to relative efficiency. That is, as the number of processors increases by a factor, the time to solution is expected to decrease by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The fraction between the expected scaling and the actual scaling is the relative efficiency. If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see link:#MetricOfInterest[???]). To request this chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

[[RelativeEfficiencyOneEvent]]
=== Relative Efficiency for One Event

The Relative Efficiency for One Event chart shows how one event from an application scales with respect to relative efficiency. That is, as the number of processors increases by a factor, the time to solution is expected to decrease by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The fraction between the expected scaling and the actual scaling is the relative efficiency. If there is more than one event to choose from, and you have not yet selected an event of interest, you may be prompted to select the event of interest (see link:#EventOfInterest[???]). If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see link:#MetricOfInterest[???]). To request this chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

[[RelativeSpeedup]]
=== Relative Speedup

The Relative Speedup chart shows how an application scales with respect to relative speedup. That is, as the number of processors increases by a factor, the speedup is expected to increase by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The ideal speedup is charted, along with the actual speedup for the application. If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see link:#MetricOfInterest[???]). To request this chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

[[RelativeSpeedupByEvent]]
=== Relative Speedup by Event

The Relative Speedup By Event chart shows how the events in an application scale with respect to relative speedup. That is, as the number of processors increases by a factor, the speedup is expected to increase by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The ideal speedup is charted, along with the actual speedup for the application. If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see link:#MetricOfInterest[???]).

[[RelativeSpeedupOneEvent]]
=== Relative Speedup for One Event

The Relative Speedup for One Event chart shows how one event in an application scales with respect to relative speedup. That is, as the number of processors increases by a factor, the speedup is expected to increase by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The ideal speedup is charted, along with the actual speedup for the application. If there is more than one event to choose from, and you have not yet selected an event of interest, you may be prompted to select the event of interest (see link:#EventOfInterest[???]). If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see link:#MetricOfInterest[???]).

[[PhaseChartTypes]]
== Phase Chart Types

TAU now provides the ability to break down profiles with respect to phases of execution. One such application would be to collect separate statistics for each timestep, or group of timesteps. In order to visualize the variance between the phases of execution, a number of phase-based charts are available.

[[RelativeEfficiencyPhase]]
